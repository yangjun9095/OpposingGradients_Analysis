function main_normalize_expression_mostAnteriorPoints
%% Description 
% This script is for exploring the fold-change idea of 17.5% of APbin as a
% proxy for Runt nulls. 

%% 
% 1) Take 17.5% of APbin's mean spot fluo data for each dataset.
% 2) Divide the mean spot fluo from each AP bin with 1)
% 3) First, compile all datasets with their sex
% Start with [000], [111], then move to [100]/[010]/[001]
% Caveat : Pick female embryos only at this moment.

%% Load the datasets
