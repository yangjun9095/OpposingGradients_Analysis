function compare_r3_old_new_versions
%% this is for comparing the old and new construct
% we have pretty much all datasets for both.
% One good comparison is r3 old vs new, since the only difference is the 1
% bp point mutation in the eve promoter.
% This will tell us how much that point mutation matters.
